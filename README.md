# Daily_Planner



 This application was created to make a Daily Planner.

 The elements on the page are all created dynamically with javascript.

 We use moment.js to generate the time and date of the current day.

 User input is saved upon click and stored for current day then refreshed when new day begins.

 Classes are added dynamically to represent present, future and present which are color coded so the the user can easily identify sections.
